# physics-lab
A modular 2D physics engine built in modern C++, featuring particle‑based fluids, rigid‑body dynamics, and planned GPU acceleration via custom CUDA kernels.

## Current Capabilities
* Cross‑platform build system using **CMake**
* Automated **Linux + Windows CI** using GitHub Actions
* Integrated **SDL3** rendering layer within clean, modular architecture
* Vendored **Eigen** library for linear algebra foundations
* Basic particle simulation with screen‑edge collision response using per-particle restitution and friction values

## Planned Features
* Particle-particle collision detection and resolution.
* Rigid‑body dynamics for convex polygons and constraints
* GPU acceleration of physics calculations using custom CUDA kernels
* Continuous delivery of build artifacts (Linux + Windows)

## Current Demo
